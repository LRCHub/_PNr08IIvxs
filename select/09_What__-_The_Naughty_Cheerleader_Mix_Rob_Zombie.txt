Alright

I'm breathing to the dead
With a billy club in my hand
Jack the Ripper said
What
She married a monster
On the very last day
She turned around and said
What
I was a teenage
A something or other
With a church fireman
What

Vampire lovers in palm bikinis said
On and on and on and on
Cannibal man and the jungle girls say
On and on and on and on

Let's go

A black cobweb
A Fu Manchu
They do not know what to do
What
I got a motel
With the red eyes and
I can hear you screaming
What
A pale hermaphrodite
Losing his sense sometimes
My God does not understand

Vampire lovers in palm bikinis said
On and on and on and on
Cannibal man and the jungle girls say
On and on and on and on

A midnight owl brings
Permanent scabs
I missed ol' rock and roll

Fate and chili dogs
Knives and pom poms
Knives and pom poms

Rave on with me
Rave on with me
Rave on with me

Vampire lovers in palm bikinis said
On and on and on and on
Cannibal man and the jungle girls say
On and on and on and on

Rave on with
Rave on with
Rave on with

On and on

Rave on with
Rave on with
Rave on with

On and on
