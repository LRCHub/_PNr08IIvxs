There's no doubt
I can tell you're acting
your heart out
And she's addicted
Obsessed, like,
"I know I can fix him"
(Oh-oh-oh)
She's got hearts in her eyes
And she draws me kissing
other guys
Her love, the type
Where she don't know
where to draw the line, oh-oh-oh
Cheerleader
Thought she needed me,
but I need her
It's not fair
'Cause I knew you
like the back of my hands
Don't you care?
I gave you everything, ah
Now I feel you even when
you're not there
It's kinda sad how
It's not your fault
you're living in a madhouse
I can't back down
Aren't you tired of blending
into the background? (Oh-oh-oh)
She's got hearts in her eyes
Saying, "Boy,
you better watch the time
'Cause if you're not mine
I'd rather
see you burned alive," oh-oh-oh
Cheerleader
Says she hates me
'cause I'm not hers
It's not fair
'Cause I knew you
like the back of my hands
Don't you care?
I gave you everything, ah
Now I feel you even when
you're not there
Somehow
I don't even know
what she does now
But do I wish her the best or
do I actually miss her?
She had hearts in her eyes
She was rootin' for me
all the time
Her love, the type
That makes you dedicate
your life
Oh, my cheerleader
Thought she needed me,
but I need her
It's not fair
'Cause I knew you
like the back of my hands
Don't you care?
I gave you everything, ah
Now I feel you even when
you're not there
Yeah, I feel you even when
you're not there
