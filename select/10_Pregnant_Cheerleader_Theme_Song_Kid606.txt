Ready, O.K.
I'm sexy, I'm cute
I'm popular to boot,
I'm bitchin, great hair, the boys all love to stare,
I'm wanted, I'm hot, I'm everything your not,
I'm pretty, I'm cool, I dominate the school,
Who am I just guess, guys wanna touch my chest.

I'm rockin', I smile and many think I'm vile,
I'm fun, I jump, you can look but don't you hump. whoo!
I'm major, I roar, I swear I'm not a whore!
We cheer and we lead, we act like we're on speed.
Hate us "cause we're beautiful" well we don't like you either
